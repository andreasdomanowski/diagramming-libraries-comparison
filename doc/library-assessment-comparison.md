# Disclaimer
All information which was taken into account for the decision for or against a diagramming library was gathered until april 2021.

# Ease of development
- Documentation
  - JointJS is a mature library which provides an extensive documentation and examples, Diagram.js in comparison does neither
- "Gimmicks"
  - Diagram.js offers functionality like resize handlers, key handlers, or direct editing, that JointJS offers just with Rappid (commercial version)
# Customization

# Usability
- Diagram.js provides convenient tools like a palette or context actions. JointJS unfortunately does not, just its big (commercial) brother Rappid.

# Community support
- considering e.g. StackOverflow or vendor message boards, JointJS excels Diagram.js
    - JointJS - many post/problems and solutions can be found
    - Diagram.js - posts mostly about BPMN.io (solution built on top of Diagram.js), almost nothing on StackOverflow
